## Description
What why and how
Create a web page from scratch that will serve as my portfolio page. In building this web application I will help to showcase skills and what I have learned so far. I will be able to direct any potential employers. My porfolio will allow me to effectievly  show what my strong areas are as well as any deployed web applications. In building this web application I will put to use what I have learned so far in this course.

## User Story
If an Employer goes to my web application and wants to see my skills they can view my web application as an example. If they want to see more, work samples will be on my porfolio. This will hopefully convince them that I am a good candidate for potential openings.

## Directions
Use what I have learned so far in this course mainly with CSS, Flexbox, & media queries to build a web application that will act as my porfolio. This portfolio is meant to showcase my work and should include a way I can be contacted. 

## Acceptance Criteria
Tentative
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## MockUp
The following is what the web page should look like:
