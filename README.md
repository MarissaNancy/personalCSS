## Description
Create a web page from scratch that will serve as my portfolio page. In building this web application I will help to showcase skills and what I have learned so far. I will be able to direct any potential employers. My porfolio will allow me to effectievly  show what my strong areas are as well as any deployed web applications. In building this web application I will put to use what I have learned so far in this course.

## User Story
If an Employer goes to my web application and wants to see my skills they can view my web application as an example. If they want to see more, work samples will be on my porfolio. This will hopefully convince them that I am a good candidate for potential openings.

## Directions
Use what I have learned so far in this course mainly with CSS, Flexbox, & media queries to build a web application that will act as my porfolio. This portfolio is meant to showcase my work and should include a way I can be contacted. 

## Acceptance Criteria
Portfolio loads and sample work loads sucessfully. Developers name and photo or avatar loads. When links to sections about me or work loads and links work well, links should take you to correct section. When clicking on images of work and they are successfully linked to work. Web page should be easy to use.

## MockUp
The following is what the web page should look like:
