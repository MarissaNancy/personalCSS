            </aside>
                <p>My name is Nancy and I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I was first introduced to coding back when MySpace was popular and everyone wanted to have the best layout. After doing some research I realized I could personalize my profile by altering the code and I was drawn into learning more. I liked creating something based off what I had pictured in my head and making it a reality. That's why I like coding because if you can imagine it you can code it!</p>
